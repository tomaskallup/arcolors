# Arcolors
A customized colorscheme with focus on Tree Sitter (mainly typescript, typescriptreact, css/sass).
Only gui colors are defined, so `set termguicolors` is required.

## Installation
Use your favorite plugin manager eg. [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```vim
Plug 'tomaskallup/arcolors'

colorscheme arcolors
set termguicolors
```
